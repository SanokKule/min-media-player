# min-media-player 1.0
## [HFS](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs) plugin adding a minimalistic media player
## Proper `mime types` should be defined in HFS, for example: [hfs-mime-types](https://github.com/SanokKule/min-media-player/blob/main/hfs-mime-types.txt)
### If you are having problems with playing back H265/HEVC you might need to enable `chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist` flag in your chromium based browser.
### For Microsoft Edge you need the paid [HEVC Video Extensions](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NMZLZ57R3T7)

### Most of the code borrowed from [rejetto/simple-player](https://github.com/rejetto/simple-player)
